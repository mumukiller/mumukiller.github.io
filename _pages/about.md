With over a decade of experience in Java backend development, half of which has been dedicated to the dynamic field of banking, I bring a wealth of expertise in crafting robust and efficient solutions for financial institutions. Over the past six years, I've also been deeply immersed in the world of high-load development, honing my skills in managing and optimizing systems under heavy demand.

In my journey spanning a decade, I've recently discovered that it's entirely possible to uncover a startup where the standards of code quality and architectural excellence soar to heights that even well-established projects may find challenging to achieve. This revelation has illuminated my belief that anything is possible in the realm of technology and software development.

My passion lies in building exceptional products, collaborating with talented individuals, and pushing the boundaries of technology. I am unequivocally driven by my obsession with the product, the people involved, and the ever-evolving world of technology.

In summary, my career trajectory is a testament to my commitment to excellence in Java backend development, my specialization in the intricacies of the banking sector, and my dedication to conquering the challenges of high-load development. My belief in the limitless possibilities of technology fuels my passion for creating exceptional products and fostering meaningful collaborations.
